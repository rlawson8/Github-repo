# Orchestra
I played [viola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola) in an orchestra for seven years
from middle school through high school. In High
School I was in the highest level which was titled
Symphonic. Through this program I traveled to 
both Nashville and New York to perform and compete, winning 
first place in both.
