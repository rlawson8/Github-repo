# Tae-Kwon-Do

For about 10 years I did Tae-Kwon-Do at a 
place called [Park's Martial Arts](http://parksma.net/) near where I lived.
I made it up to a second degree black belt, and began
teaching when I entered High School.

I'm the one on the right

The belt rankings are as follows at the school
1. white
1. yellow
1. orange
1. green
1. blue
1. purple
1. brown
1. high brown
1. red 
1. high red 
1. recommendation 
1. black

It took me roughly four years to get each black belt.
