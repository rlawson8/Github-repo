# Climbing
I climbed a lot throughout high school with my team,
and some here at college whenever I can find the time.

I've traveled a lot too. Holy Boulders in Illinois
is a great place to go with routes for beginners
as well as advanced climbers. I've also been to 
[Earth Treks](https://www.earthtreksclimbing.com/) in Colorado. It is the largest climbing gym
in America. While I was there I also got the chance
to do some climbing out doors at various parks.

There are various skill ratings when it comes to climbing
- vb
- v1-v2
- v3-v4
- v5-v6
- v7-v8

and the list goes on.
I usually find myself in the v5-v6 range which
isn't bad for only having climbed a little more than a year.
